Okay, I'm probably not your typical Linux guy. I don't do python or web dev, I don't work with servers. I don't care much about open source. I might describe myself as an old school UNIX geek, though UNIX is older than I am. Well, in any case I'm very much into simple computing, it's just my understanding of "simple" differs a bit from the mainstream.
